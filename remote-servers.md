# WORK ON REMOTE SERVERS + PERSONAL COMPUTERS

In the first stage of the course we will use remote servers to run the exercises.
This will allow us all to use the same computing environment under the complete control of the instructors.
This will help us only focus on learning the basics without Worry about the configurations and particularities of each computer.

Once the fundamental concepts are internalized, the second part of the course can continue on each participant’s personal computers.
This will allow everyone to use their own computer and become familiar with how to use brightway and flodym in and out of classrooms.

## Available servers

_Please_ follow instructors advice on which server to select. The ideal is have a good balance of number of participants per server.
